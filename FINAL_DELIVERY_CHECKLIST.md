## Known Limitations & Disclaimers

### Important Notes for Client

⚠️ **Preliminary Data Warning:**
All frequency response measurements shown in Section 3.4 are PRELIMINARY field data and have NOT been validated through comprehensive acoustic simulation. Final system design requires:

1. **AutoCAD file from mosque administration** (NOT YET RECEIVED)
2. **Comprehensive acoustic simulation** using EASE/ODEON/CATT software
3. **Minimum 12 measurement positions** (currently only 6 tested)
4. **New baseline measurements** with current carpet installation
5. **Validated simulation results** before equipment procurement

### Data Accuracy Disclaimer

The frequency response graphs are based on:
- ACOUSTIC_SIMULATION_SPECIFICATION.md reference document
- Industry-standard acoustic modeling principles
- Preliminary field measurements (unvalidated)
- Manufacturer specifications for reference equipment

**Final design will be based on validated simulation results, not this preliminary data.**

---

## Next Steps for Client

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Review Report:**
   - Review all 15 frequency response graphs
   - Verify understanding of existing system degradation
   - Confirm proposed system target response is acceptable

2. **Provide Missing Data:**
   - **AutoCAD architectural file** (CRITICAL - blocks simulation)
   - Precise ceiling heights at multiple points
   - Updated material absorption data (new carpet)
   - Column positions and dimensions

3. **Schedule Simulation Phase:**
   - Approve budget for acoustic simulation software
   - Confirm access to mosque for follow-up measurements
   - Schedule post-Ramadan re-measurement session

4. **Approve Project Timeline:**
