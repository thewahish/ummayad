1. Introduction & Project Background

1.1. Timeline & Initial Mission Scope

Link to 1.1. Timeline & Initial Mission Scope Upon being invited to the Umayyad Mosque, we (Obai Sukar and Karam Abdul Karim) initiated a mission to assess and attempt to improve the existing sound system in preparation for Ramadan, utilizing the resources available within a constrained timeframe. Our primary goal was to optimize and enhance audio intelligibility for sermons, prayers, and the call to prayer (adhan) using practical tools and methods developed through our expertise. To support this effort and ensure effective coverage, we propose achieving clear, consistent audibility across all zones (prayer hall, courtyard, minarets, and Athan Room) through directional speakers, digital signal processing (DSP) with zone-specific processing, and precise speaker placement, as detailed in Sections 4.2 and 4.3. We purchased the following equipment to help improve the audio with minimal intervention during our visit:

	•	dbx AFS2 Advanced Feedback Suppression Processor
	•	Sennheiser XSW 1-835 Dual Wireless Dual Handheld Microphone System
	•	AKG C414 XLII Large-diaphragm Condenser Microphone
	•	dbx 215s Dual 15-band Graphic Equalizer
	•	EBL Rechargeable Batteries and Charger

Current Equipment Specifications: 
The following detailed specifications for the current equipment have been verified through manufacturer data, on-site observations, and your provided information, forming the technical baseline for our assessment and addressing audit findings on specification accuracy. This updated list consolidates all identified components, with estimated years of manufacture based on model release dates and technological context, excluding subwoofers as Quran recitation and Inshad do not require bass, per the audit and your input. The equipment includes a diverse array of speakers—Dynacord Speakers (est. 1995–2000), Inter-M Professional SE-8 Loud Speaker and SE-8 SPEAKER (est. 1998–2002), TOA TU652 Driver Unit (est. 1990–1995), Proel PR10AL CEILING LOUDSPEAKER (est. 2005–2010), Sound Column Speaker (est. 1995–2000), TOA TZ-205 COLUMN SPEAKER (est. 1995–2000), Turbosound Impact TCI53 Full-Range Loudspeaker (est. 2000–2005), UNI-PEX MINI SONO -COLUMN SC-10J Speaker and SC-10JA Sonocolumn Speaker (est. 2000–2005), and PASO Column Speaker (est. 1995–2000)—reflecting the fragmented and inconsistent system noted during our visit. Mixers comprise the SoundCraft LX7ii-32 (est. 1996–2000), which was mysteriously blown, raising concerns about potential sabotage or lack of accountability. Amplifiers include the Crown Com-Tech 800 (est. 2005–2010), three Proel PRL 1400 units (est. 2010–2015), the UNI-PEX PA Amplifier (est. 2000–2005), two 400 Series Amplifiers with manual tone controls (est. 1990–1995, make and model TBD), and the inferred PROEL AUP120 and PROEL AUP480R (est. 2005–2010), contributing to the system’s complexity. Additionally, purchased equipment—dbx AFS2 Advanced Feedback Suppression Processor, Sennheiser XSW 1-835 Dual Wireless Dual Handheld Microphone System, AKG C414 XLII Large-diaphragm Condenser Microphone, dbx 215s Dual 15-band Graphic Equalizer, and EBL Rechargeable Batteries and Charger—remains available for future integration, with no manufacturing year as they are recent acquisitions. However, upon arrival, we encountered significant challenges, including missing equipment, a dirty floor, messy cables, and a disorganized rack, all of which compromised functionality and safety. The lack of documentation, absence of staff training, and resistance from mosque personnel further hindered our assessment, while unauthorized volume increases and tampering have led to frequent blown speakers. The daily changes and theft of equipment exacerbate these issues, necessitating a comprehensive reevaluation post-Ramadan to verify each unit’s condition, confirm manufacturing years, and optimize power distribution.

These specifications address the audit’s concerns by aligning with manufacturer data where available (e.g., TOA TU652 at 200 Hz–6 kHz, 111 dB sensitivity; correcting overstated bass performance), distinguishing continuous vs. peak power, and noting impedance options (8Ω or 100V line where applicable). The SoundCraft LX7ii-32’s 32 mono channels are confirmed as analog, resolving prior discrepancies. Subwoofers are excluded, as Quran recitation and Inshad do not require bass, per the audit and your input.

However, upon arrival, we encountered significant challenges that hindered our ability to conduct a thorough assessment and implement improvements. We observed that critical equipment was frequently missing, the floor was dirty, cables were messy, and the rack for equipment was disorganized, all of which compromised the system’s functionality and safety. When we attempted to perform further analysis, the mixer (in my opinion, Obai Sukar, this may not have been a coincidence) was mysteriously blown, raising concerns about potential sabotage or lack of accountability. Additionally, we found no documentation whatsoever, no accountability for equipment maintenance or operation, and no evidence of staff training, exacerbating the resistance and pushback from the mosque staff, which prevented us from installing or utilizing our purchased equipment. We also noted that speakers are constantly blown due to unauthorized volume increases or tampering with settings (e.g., EQ, volume), leading to equipment failure and inconsistent performance. 
Upon our findings, we identified a highly fragmented and inconsistent speaker system currently installed, comprising a wide variety of speaker types and brands, making it extremely difficult for us, working alone, to verify the functionality and condition of each unit. The list of installed equipment, as confirmed through the images you provided and cross-referenced with our observations, includes:

	•	Dynacord Speakers
	•	Inter-M Professional SE-8 Loud Speaker
	•	INTER-M SE-8 SPEAKER
	•	TOA TU652 Driver Unit
	•	Proel PR10AL CEILING LOUDSPEAKER
	•	Sound Column Speaker
	•	TOA TZ-205 COLUMN SPEAKER
	•	Turbosound Impact TCI53 Full-Range Loudspeaker
	•	UNI-PEX MINI SONO -COLUMN SC-10J Speaker
	•	UNI-PEX SC-10JA Sonocolumn Speaker
	•	PASO Column Speaker

Realistically, given the sheer number and diversity of these speakers—spanning multiple brands (Dynacord, Inter-M, TOA, PROEL, Turbosound, UNI-PEX, PASO)—and the presence of amplifiers and mixers installed on multiple different phases over time using various vendors, it was nearly impossible for us to verify each unit’s condition or perform proper power distribution calculations for speaker placement. The “A” and “B” markings on the floor plan represent only some of the current interior column speakers, but in my professional opinion, Obai Sukar, there are far more speakers than indicated, making it impractical to count and locate them due to their abundance, inconsistent connectivity, lack of documentation on their connections, and the numerous changes occurring during our visit. No one would benefit from dedicating resources to such an effort, especially given the constant changes, the fact that some speakers are not even connected, and others produce no sound output, making the task impractical. The images you provided, marked with “A” (e.g., PASO Column Speaker) and “B” (e.g., UNI-PEX MINI SONO-COLUMN, TOA TZ-205 COLUMN SPEAKER), confirm this fragmentation and disorganization, with messy cables and a disorganized rack visible in the mixer and amplifier photos. This fragmentation, combined with missing equipment, dirty conditions, messy cables, and a disorganized rack, further complicated our assessment. Notably, during our visit, we found no functioning exterior speakers for the courtyard, with only TOA TZ-205 COLUMN SPEAKERS designated for the minarets (exterior) performing inadequately, providing no audio in some market areas and much fainter audio in others, leading to inadequate coverage and performance issues. The remaining speakers (Dynacord, Inter-M, PROEL, Turbosound, UNI-PEX, PASO) for the interior also struggled with inconsistent performance due to blown speakers and unauthorized adjustments. To improve coverage and prevent blown speakers, we propose replacing these speakers with high-powered, unified systems and implementing DSP-based limits, password-protected settings, physical lockouts on controls, and staff training, as detailed in Sections 4.1 and 4.2. After our departure, we learned that the carpet was changed, which also affects the sonic quality and results, adding complexity to our acoustic analysis, including potential feedback challenges in the Athan Room and Mihrab areas. Despite this resistance, we expanded our scope to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the entire sound infrastructure, identifying these deficiencies and proposing a long-term upgrade strategy based on our technical analysis and recommendations. The equipment we purchased remains available for future use in the implementation of our proposed system, ensuring they can be integrated later to enhance audio performance and maintain consistent coverage.

We conducted a basic acoustic analysis during our visit, utilizing limited on-site observations and virtual simulation to predict challenges, but this initial assessment will be revised and refined due to the changes in speakers and the recent carpet replacement, which impact the sonic environment. Final adjustments will require comprehensive measurements once the system stabilizes. Proper documentation of the current system was challenging due to ongoing modifications, but we plan to document it comprehensively—both before and after the upgrade project—through our efforts to ensure transparency, accuracy, and prevention of tampering, including setting up secure DSP and mixer configurations to maintain performance and prevent blown speakers. 
We provided images of the current installations for further cross-referencing with the “A” and “B” markings on the floor plan, obtained from the mosque staff and verified by us, to validate our findings and inform our redesign, as part of our ongoing efforts. 
Rather than withdrawing, we persisted in our efforts, determining that the mosque’s audio system suffers from deep-rooted inconsistencies accumulated over time. Through our expertise, we concluded that a thorough redesign and implementation of a new system, incorporating modern equipment, precise system design, and best practices derived from our analysis, are essential for a sustainable solution ensuring clear, consistent audio coverage across all zones. We recognize the urgent need to address the lack of documentation, accountability, and training, which we will prioritize in our upgrade plan, including measures to prevent blown speakers by restricting unauthorized access to settings.

1.2. Testing & Feedback Collection Methodology
Link to 1.2. Testing & Feedback Collection Methodology Given the mosque’s wide range of applications, testing will require evaluating different scenarios and real-world use cases. The sound system must be optimized for various applications, each with its unique requirements:

	•	Lectures (دروس ومحاضرات) 
	•	Speech intelligibility is critical, ensuring clarity across all zones without excessive reverberation.
	•	Microphones and speaker placements must be tested with live speech recordings and adjusted accordingly.
	•	Khutbas (خطبة الجمعة) 
	•	Requires a powerful yet clear sound projection to ensure speech is audible in all sections of the mosque.
	•	Testing will include live recitations to fine-tune gain settings, equalization, and loudspeaker balance.
	•	Prayers (الصلوات) 
	•	The Imam’s voice must be intelligible and evenly distributed across the mosque.
	•	Delay management must be optimized to prevent phase issues between different zones.
	•	Inshad (الإنشاد الديني) 
	•	Singing and chanting require a dynamic sound system capable of handling both soft and powerful vocals.
	•	Testing will involve real-world performances to adjust reverberation levels and feedback suppression.
	•	Athan (الأذان) 
	•	The minaret horn speakers must project the Athan clearly to the surrounding market.
	•	Volume levels must be tested in various weather conditions to ensure consistent audibility.

Ultimately, testing will be conducted through live audio playback, direct speech testing, and real-time feedback collection from Imams, Muadhins, and mosque personnel. These results will inform final adjustments to speaker placement, equalization, and power distribution, ensuring the system fulfills the diverse requirements of the mosque’s applications.

For the current setup, which exhibited daily changes, the following measurements reflect the natural frequency response at multiple locations, considering two scenarios: one utilizing the existing speakers (noted for their frequent alterations and instances of non-functioning units, as previously mentioned), and the other employing Yamaha HS8 reference speakers.





2. Architectural Overview & Acoustic Analysis

2.1. Architectural Overview of the Umayyad Mosque

Link to 2.1. Architectural Overview of the Umayyad Mosque Through our collaboration with the Umayyad Mosque staff, we obtained detailed architectural information, including dimensions, floor plans, and scale, which we verified against web sources (e.g., ARCHNET.ORG). Based on this data and our analysis, we identified the following features of the mosque, which we used to inform our sound system design, aiming for clear, consistent audio coverage across all zones (prayer hall, courtyard, minarets, and Athan Room):
	•	Overall Dimensions: The mosque forms a rectangular structure, with 
	•	dimensions to be precisely identified once we obtain the AutoCAD file from the mosque staff, as confirmed through our verification with web resources (ARCHNET.ORG).

	•	Main Prayer Hall (Haram - Interior):
	•	Located in the southern part of the mosque, the haram is where worshippers gather for prayers and features the mihrab (محراب) and minbar (المنبر), as described by the mosque staff.
	•	The hall includes three arcades parallel to the qibla wall, intersected by a larger, higher arcade perpendicular to the qibla, leading to the mihrab and minbar. This layout, detailed in the floor plan provided by the staff and verified by us, contributes to the space’s acoustic complexity, with the central nave, pillars (including Corinthian columns), and domes affecting sound distribution and requiring precise speaker placement for consistent coverage.
	•	The Dome of the Eagle, an octagonal dome positioned along the central nave, with its height and precise position to be confirmed once we obtain the AutoCAD file, adds to the architectural grandeur but also creates challenges for sound reflection and reverberation, necessitating directional speakers and DSP to ensure clear audibility without risking blown speakers.

	•	Courtyard (Sahn - Exterior):
	•	Occupying the northern section, the courtyard is a large open area surrounded by arcades (riwaq) supported by alternating stone columns and piers, used for overflow worshippers and public gatherings, as reported by the mosque staff and verified by us (ARCHNET.ORG).
	•	It requires effective sound coverage for the adhan and announcements, but currently suffers from inadequate audibility, with no audio in some market areas and much fainter audio in others, as observed during our visit, due to the absence of functioning exterior speakers, further complicated by the carpet change after our departure, which affects sonic quality. To improve coverage, we propose installing high-powered, weatherproof line array speakers, as detailed in Section 4.2.

	•	Minarets (3 Towers):
	•	Comprises the Minaret of the Bride, Minaret of Jesus, and Minaret of Qaitbay, used for broadcasting the adhan to distant areas, as identified through our discussions with the mosque staff and verified with web resources.
	•	Current minaret speakers (e.g., TOA TZ-205 COLUMN SPEAKER) underperform, providing inconsistent or no audio coverage in the surrounding market areas, contributing to inadequate audibility. We propose replacing these with weatherproof column speakers and implementing DSP-based limits to ensure consistent coverage and prevent blown speakers, as detailed in Section 4.2.

	•	Athan Room (غرفة الأذان الجماعي):
	•	A dedicated room where eight performers recite the adhan together, requiring high-quality microphones and monitor speakers for synchronized performance and clear feedback, ensuring consistent audibility, as described by the mosque staff and incorporated into our analysis. The current system lacks sufficient monitoring, leading to inconsistent feedback for performers, as observed during our visit. We propose dedicated monitor speakers and anti-feedback measures, as detailed in Section 4.2, to achieve reliable coverage.

2.2. Acoustic Analysis & Findings

Link to 2.2. Acoustic Analysis & Findings Through our efforts, we conducted a basic acoustic analysis of the Umayyad Mosque during our visit, utilizing limited on-site observations and virtual simulation to predict challenges. This initial assessment will be revised and refined due to the changes in speakers and the recent carpet replacement, which impact the sonic environment. We identified the following challenges with the current sound system, noting that precise dimensions and features will be finalized once we obtain the AutoCAD file for accurate modeling, and accounting for the carpet change affecting sonic quality. Our goal is to ensure clear, consistent audio coverage across all zones, addressing the current system’s deficiencies where speakers fail to provide reliable audibility due to blown speakers and unauthorized adjustments:

Reverberation & Reflection Issues
	•	The prayer hall’s high ceilings, domes (e.g., Dome of the Eagle), and hard surfaces (e.g., marble, stone) generate significant sound reflections, resulting in excessive reverberation times, as observed in our basic analysis. Studies suggest RT60 in large domed mosques like Umayyad can exceed 5–6 seconds, aligning with our estimate of 3.8–5.2 seconds, far exceeding the ideal 1–2 seconds for speech intelligibility, leading to poor audibility and inconsistent coverage.
	•	Low frequencies (below 400 Hz) are particularly problematic, with standing waves and low-frequency buildup causing muddiness in audio, exacerbating inconsistent audibility and often leading to blown speakers when volumes are raised to compensate.

Sound Distribution & Delay Problems
	•	The large prayer hall and courtyard, coupled with multiple speaker types, result in delay mismatches, creating echo effects in certain zones, which disrupts consistent audio coverage.
	•	Our measurements indicate an average delay variance of 28–45 ms between speaker locations, exceeding the recommended threshold of under 15 ms for coherent speech alignment, further contributing to inconsistent audibility and blown speakers when volumes are raised to compensate.

Acoustic Interference from Architectural Features
	•	Pillars (including Corinthian columns), domes, arcades, and the alternating stone columns and piers in the courtyard create natural sound barriers, leading to uneven sound distribution and shadowing in specific areas, resulting in inconsistent or no audio coverage for worshippers.
	•	Our analysis reveals significant gaps in audibility, particularly impacting speech reinforcement and contributing to blown speakers when volumes are increased to compensate.

Muadhin & Imam Monitoring Requirements
	•	The muadhins and imams require clear auditory feedback during the adhan, prayers, and recitations to perform effectively, ensuring consistent audio coverage for both performers and the congregation, as observed during our assessment.
	•	The current system lacks sufficient monitoring, causing performers to overcompensate vocally, leading to pitch and tonal inconsistencies and blown speakers when volumes are raised, particularly in the prayer hall and Athan Room.

Inadequate Coverage in Courtyard & Surrounding Areas
	•	The exterior courtyard (sahn) and adjacent market areas suffer from inadequate audibility due to damaged or removed speakers, with no audio in some areas and much fainter audio in others, as identified through our on-site observations. During our visit, we found no functioning exterior speakers for the courtyard, with only TOA TZ-205 COLUMN SPEAKERS designated for the minarets (exterior) performing inadequately, contributing to inconsistent coverage and blown speakers when attempts are made to increase volume.
	•	Our observations indicate significant gaps in audio coverage, and minaret speakers fail to provide reliable audibility to the surrounding community, often leading to equipment failure due to unauthorized adjustments.

Additional Performance and Operational Issues
	•	During our basic analysis, I (Obai Sukar) personally noted distortion in the signal, which degraded audio quality, and occasional feedback (e.g., high-pitched squealing) that disrupted proceedings, both of which need addressing to ensure clear sound across all applications.
	•	Not all staff were trained on how to properly handle or operate microphones, leading to inconsistent use and further exacerbating audio issues.
	•	There was no clear accountability or a fully knowledgeable person in charge to oversee the sound system, contributing to mismanagement and poor maintenance.
	•	We observed significant theft of equipment, with items claimed to be non-working subsequently disappearing, and every day during our visit, some equipment was reported missing, undermining the system’s reliability and availability.

3. Floor Plan Analysis & Current Speaker Placement

Link to 3. Floor Plan Analysis & Current Speaker Placement Through our efforts, we analyzed the mosque’s floor plan, obtained from the Umayyad Mosque staff and verified with web resources (e.g., ARCHNET.ORG), which includes the prayer hall, courtyard, three minarets, mihrab placements, and the Athan Room. We provided images of the current installations for further cross-referencing with the “A” and “B” markings on the floor plan, obtained from the mosque staff and verified by us, to validate our findings and inform our redesign, as part of our ongoing efforts. Our key observations, based on this data, the images, and our expertise, include:

	•	Dimensions: The mosque forms a rectangular structure, with dimensions to be precisely identified once we obtain the AutoCAD file from the mosque staff, as confirmed through our verification with web sources (ARCHNET.ORG). The prayer hall occupies the southern portion, while the courtyard spans the northern section, with arcades, archways, and minarets extending the layout. The main prayer hall features Corinthian columns, and the central nave includes the Dome of the Eagle, impacting sound propagation and contributing to inconsistent coverage, as mapped by us.
	•	Current Speaker Placement: The floor plan marks existing speaker locations with blue “A” and “B” notations along the interior walls and potentially near columns. In my professional opinion, Obai Sukar, these markings represent only some of the current interior column speakers, but there are far more speakers than indicated, making it impractical to count and locate them due to their abundance, inconsistent connectivity, lack of documentation on their connections, and the numerous changes occurring during our visit. No one would benefit from dedicating resources to such an effort, especially given the constant changes, the fact that some speakers are not even connected, and others produce no sound output, making the task impractical. The images you provided, marked with “A” (e.g., PASO Column Speaker) and “B” (e.g., UNI-PEX MINI SONO-COLUMN, TOA TZ-205 COLUMN SPEAKER), confirm this fragmentation and disorganization, with messy cables and a disorganized rack visible in the mixer and amplifier photos. Along with amplifiers and a mixer (PROEL AUP120, PROEL AUP480R, SoundCraft LX7ii-32), installed on multiple different phases over time using various vendors, contributing to inconsistencies in placement, power distribution, and performance, leading to inconsistent or no audio coverage. Notably, during our visit, we found no functioning exterior speakers for the courtyard, with only TOA TZ-205 COLUMN SPEAKERS designated for the minarets (exterior) performing inadequately, providing no audio in some market areas and much fainter audio in others, contributing to inadequate coverage and blown speakers due to unauthorized adjustments. The remaining speakers (Dynacord, Inter-M, PROEL, Turbosound, UNI-PEX, PASO) for the interior also struggled with inconsistent performance due to blown speakers and unauthorized changes. This fragmentation, combined with missing equipment, dirty conditions, messy cables, and a disorganized rack, further complicated our assessment. After our departure, we learned that the carpet was changed, which also affects the sonic quality and results, adding complexity to our acoustic analysis, including potential feedback challenges in the Athan Room and Mihrab areas.
	•	Architectural Features: We identified pillars (including Corinthian columns), domes (e.g., Dome of the Eagle), arcades, archways, and minarets, which impact sound propagation and contribute to inconsistent coverage in specific structural sections like the mihrab, central dome, side aisles, archways, and courtyard, as documented through our efforts. Precise locations and measurements will be finalized once we obtain the AutoCAD file for accurate mapping, accounting for the carpet change’s impact on acoustics, potential feedback issues, and measures to prevent blown speakers through secure settings and lockouts.

Based on this analysis, we propose relocating and supplementing the current speaker positions, informed by the images and list of installed equipment, to ensure consistent, reliable audio coverage, as detailed in Section 4.2 Speakers, by dividing the mosque into distinct acoustic zones and mapping precise dimensions for pillar placements, mihrab location, and other features, all developed through our expertise, once we obtain and utilize the AutoCAD file in our simulation process, adjusted for the carpet change and incorporating anti-feedback and anti-tampering measures for the Athan Room and Mihrab.

4.3. Strategies to Improve Speech Intelligibility 
Link to 4.3. Strategies to Improve Speech Intelligibility Through our efforts, we developed the following adjustments to optimize audio clarity and ensure consistent, reliable audio coverage across all zones, aligning with our proposed system and addressing the fragmented current setup (e.g., Dynacord, Inter-M, TOA, PROEL, Turbosound, UNI-PEX, PASO), based on architectural features obtained from the mosque staff and verified by us, with precise dimensions to be determined using the AutoCAD file, accounting for the carpet change’s impact on acoustics, incorporating anti-feedback methods to address the observed feedback issues for the Athan Room and Mihrab speakers, and preventing blown speakers through secure settings and lockouts. The audit recommends enhancing these strategies with beam-steering arrays and feedback control:
	•	Use Directional Speakers
	•	We advise avoiding broadcasting sound into reflective surfaces such as the Dome of the Eagle and other domes. We recommend aiming speakers (see Section 4.2 Speakers) downward toward worshippers to focus sound on the congregation, reduce reflections from high ceilings, arcades, and archways, and ensure consistent, reliable audio coverage, as designed by us, replacing the inconsistent Dynacord, Inter-M, TOA, PROEL, Turbosound, UNI-PEX, and PASO speakers, adjusted for the carpet change’s effect on reflections. The audit suggests exploring digitally steerable column arrays (e.g., Renkus-Heinz ICONYX or Meyer Sound CAL) as an alternative for critical areas, offering electronic beam control to improve intelligibility in reverberant spaces, to be evaluated if budget permits. Equipped with DSP-based anti-feedback methods and brick-wall limiters to prevent blown speakers due to unauthorized volume increases, with password-protected settings and physical lockouts to prevent tampering.
	•	We propose leveraging distributed point-source speakers, line arrays (if needed), and directional column array speakers to ensure uniform coverage and minimize reflections, particularly in the mihrab, main prayer hall, side aisles, and courtyard, while avoiding direct sound into the central dome using beam-steering technology, with final placements to be refined using the AutoCAD file, considering the carpet’s impact on sound distribution. Integrated with anti-feedback settings and secure lockouts via dbx AFS2 and dbx AFS224 for the Athan Room and Mihrab speakers to prevent blown speakers and address the feedback observed.
	•	Implement Digital Signal Processing (DSP)
	•	We recommend utilizing Dante-enabled DSP (see Section 4.1 Control Room Devices (Mixer and Amplifiers)) with zone-specific compressors, limiters, and feedback suppressors to apply equalization (EQ), auto-EQ/room correction, and time delay compensation, enhancing speech clarity and ensuring consistent audio coverage, addressing the inconsistent delays, distortion, and feedback issues of the current system, as developed through our expertise, adjusted for the carpet change’s effect on room response. The audit emphasizes feedback suppression, which we’ll ensure with dbx AFS2 and AFS224, automatically detecting and suppressing feedback frequencies (noted during our analysis) to maximize gain-before-feedback in the reflective space, particularly for the Athan Room and Mihrab, with password-protected settings and lockouts to prevent blown speakers due to tampering.
	•	We suggest using DSP feedback suppression, along with zone-specific processing and beam-steering technology, to prevent mic/speaker feedback, ensure reliable coverage, and protect against blown speakers, with settings secured against tampering, optimized using the AutoCAD file in simulation software, accounting for the carpet change, and specifically configuring anti-feedback settings for the Athan Room and Mihrab speakers via automatic frequency detection and notch filtering to eliminate the observed feedback.
	•	Reduce Reverberation
	•	We propose adding acoustic panels or diffusers where permitted by the mosque’s historical site regulations, targeting areas with excessive reflections to ensure consistent audio coverage, as part of our design, adjusted for the carpet change’s impact on reverberation, with secure DSP settings to prevent tampering and blown speakers. The audit suggests long-term consideration of reversible acoustic treatments (e.g., heavy curtains, additional carpeting) to further reduce reverberation, complementing the recent carpet change, though no structural changes are proposed in this phase.
	•	We recommend adjusting speaker placement (see Section 4.2 Speakers) and using DSP auto-EQ/room correction to minimize sound reflections, ensuring directional speakers avoid bouncing sound off domes, walls, and archways, maintaining reliable coverage, with beam-steering technology for the central dome, and final adjustments determined using the AutoCAD file, considering the carpet’s effect on acoustics. Incorporating anti-feedback methods and lockouts for the Athan Room and Mihrab speakers to prevent blown speakers.
	•	Use Multiple Delay Speakers
	•	We suggest installing delayed reinforcement speakers in large open areas to ensure synchronized, consistent audio coverage, leveraging DSP time delay compensation and zone-specific limiters (see Section 4.1 Control Room Devices (Mixer and Amplifiers)) to eliminate echo effects, addressing the current system’s inconsistencies, with precise placements finalized using the AutoCAD file, adjusted for the carpet change’s impact on delay and echo. The audit recommends calibrated delay settings to synchronize sound arrivals, which we’ll implement during commissioning. Equipped with anti-feedback settings, brick-wall limiters, and password protection to prevent blown speakers due to unauthorized adjustments in the Athan Room and Mihrab, if needed.

4.4. Testing and Optimization Process 
Link to 4.4. Testing and Optimization Process
Through our efforts, we recommend the following process to verify and optimize speech intelligibility, synchronization, and consistent, reliable audio coverage across all zones at the Umayyad Mosque, addressing the fragmented current system (e.g., Dynacord, Inter-M, TOA, PROEL, Turbosound, UNI-PEX, PASO), based on architectural features obtained from the mosque staff and verified by us, with precise dimensions and placements to be determined using the AutoCAD file, accounting for the carpet change’s impact on acoustics, ensuring anti-feedback methods to address the observed feedback for the Athan Room and Mihrab speakers, and preventing blown speakers through secure settings and lockouts. The audit highlights gaps in methodology, which we’ve addressed with data-driven enhancements, and this section aligns with the new testing methodology for diverse applications:
	•	Before Installation: We propose using simulation software such as EASE, ODEON, or CATT-Acoustic, based on our expertise, to model acoustic performance, predict intelligibility outcomes (targeting an STI of at least 0.5, ideally >0.6), and test DSP/Dante configurations (including beam-steering for the central dome, zone-specific processing, Dante networking, and anti-feedback settings for the Athan Room and Mihrab speakers) based on our proposed equipment (see Section 4.1 Control Room Devices (Mixer and Amplifiers) and Section 4.2 Speakers), aiming for consistent coverage, utilizing the AutoCAD file as part of the proper process for accurate modeling, cross-referencing with the “A” and “B” markings and images of current installations, and incorporating the carpet change’s effect on acoustic modeling, feedback potential, and prevention of blown speakers through secure settings. The audit recommends this step to verify coverage and identify dead zones.
	•	After Installation: We recommend conducting on-site measurements using STIPA analyzers and RT60 measurement tools to assess intelligibility, reverberation (baseline RT60 estimated 3.8–5.2 s, potentially 6–7 s), latency, and consistent coverage, making final adjustments as needed across the mosque layout and its zones, including testing zone-specific processing, verifying power distribution for the new unified system, tuning anti-feedback settings (dbx AFS2, dbx AFS224) for the Athan Room and Mihrab speakers to eliminate the observed feedback during adhan and sermons, ensuring reliable coverage, noting the absence of functioning exterior courtyard speakers, and adjusting for the carpet change’s impact on results, with password-protected DSP settings and physical lockouts to prevent blown speakers due to tampering. The audit suggests measuring baseline STI (0.3–0.4 currently) and targeting 75 dB at listening areas with a 15–20 dB signal-to-noise ratio above ambient noise (e.g., 55 dBA), which we’ll implement. Testing will include live audio playback, direct speech testing, and real-time feedback collection from Imams, Muadhins, and mosque personnel for lectures, khutbas, prayers, Inshad, and Athan, as outlined in Section 1.2, with Athan testing in various weather conditions to ensure consistent audibility.
	•	Optimize the System: We propose applying our recommended adjustments—directional speakers (see Section 4.2 Speakers), DSP processing (see Section 4.1 Control Room Devices (Mixer and Amplifiers)), Dante networking, multiple mics, and acoustic treatments—to achieve optimal speech clarity, synchronization, and consistent, reliable audio coverage, replacing the fragmented system with a unified design, including new exterior speakers for the courtyard and upgraded minaret speakers, with final optimizations informed by the AutoCAD file, adjusted for the carpet change’s effect on sonic quality. The audit recommends using a real-time analyzer to EQ the system, rolling off bass below 125 Hz on columns and taming mid-range peaks to avoid exciting the dome, ensuring anti-feedback methods (automatic frequency detection, notch filtering) are calibrated to address the observed distortion and feedback for the Athan Room and Mihrab speakers via the DSP and feedback suppressors, and implementing password protection and lockouts to prevent blown speakers due to unauthorized volume or EQ adjustments. Post-installation, we’ll measure STI across listener positions to confirm design goals, adjusting DSP settings as needed, and ensuring amplifiers operate with headroom to avoid distortion.

	•	Equipment Selection: Equipment selection will depend on vendor availability, local sourcing, and specific model choices, which we can refine during implementation based on our recommendations, once we obtain and utilize the AutoCAD file for precise planning, ensuring reliable coverage, adjusted for any acoustic changes due to the carpet replacement, anti-feedback requirements, and prevention of blown speakers through secure settings and lockouts.
	•	Calibration Plan: The proposed DSP, compressor/limiter, and feedback suppressor tuning align with our testing and optimization process (see Section 4.4 Testing and Optimization Process), but we emphasize on-site measurements (STIPA, RT60) and simulation software (EASE, ODEON, CATT-Acoustic) for final calibration, ensuring reliable, consistent audio coverage, adjusted for the carpet change’s effect on acoustics, and specifically tuning anti-feedback settings (dbx AFS2, dbx AFS224) and secure lockouts for the Athan Room and Mihrab speakers to eliminate feedback and prevent blown speakers during adhan and sermons, as detailed in our plan. The audit recommends calibrated delay settings and EQ adjustments (e.g., rolling off bass below 125 Hz), which we’ve incorporated.

	•	Our Final Recommendation
 We recommend adopting the external suggestion for TOA TU-660M and JBL AH7115 column speakers for minarets, DBX AFS2, DBX 166XS, Shure MX418D/C, and AKG C414, but adjusting speaker types, DSP, amplifiers, and equipment selection to align with our proposed system in Sections 4.1 Control Room Devices (Mixer and Amplifiers) and 4.2 Speakers, ensuring reliable, consistent audio coverage, with advanced anti-feedback methods and anti-tampering measures (password protection, lockouts) for the Athan Room and Mihrab speakers to prevent blown speakers, adjusted for the carpet change’s impact. We will refine this recommendation further once we obtain the AutoCAD file and cross-reference with the “A” and “B” markings and images of current installations, as part of our proper process, considering the audit’s suggestion of beam-steering arrays if budget allows.

5. Implementation Plan & Timeline

5.1. Phased Approach 
Link to 5.1. Phased Approach
Through our efforts, we propose the following phased approach to implement the sound system upgrade, ensuring consistent, reliable audio coverage across all zones, leveraging our expertise to address the issues we identified, including the fragmented and inconsistent current speaker system (e.g., Dynacord, Inter-M, TOA, PROEL, Turbosound, UNI-PEX, PASO), the observed distortion and feedback, lack of staff training, absence of accountable leadership, equipment theft, and accounting for the carpet change’s impact on acoustics, ensuring anti-feedback methods for the Athan Room and Mihrab speakers, and preventing blown speakers through secure settings and lockouts:

	•	Phase 1: Assessment & Documentation (Post-Ramadan)

The audit recommends measuring baseline RT60 (estimated 3.8–5.2 s, potentially up to 6–7 s) and STI (0.3–0.4 currently) to quantify the problem, which we’ll include to address the observed distortion and feedback.
	•	We will document the existing “A” and “B” speaker placements and system configuration for baseline comparison across acoustic zones, mapping architectural features obtained from the mosque staff and verified by us, cross-referencing with the images and list of installed equipment (see Section 3 Floor Plan Analysis & Current Speaker Placement) to validate our findings, ensuring consistent coverage is documented and achievable, with comprehensive documentation practices to address the lack of documentation we observed, including organizing and cleaning the equipment rack, addressing the dirty floor and messy cables, accounting for missing equipment due to theft, and implementing password protection and physical lockouts to prevent tampering and blown speakers, adjusted for the carpet change’s acoustic implications and feedback needs for the Athan Room and Mihrab. The audit suggests noting equipment age and condition (e.g., amplifiers showing distortion after 15 years), which we’ll assess post-Ramadan. We’ll also check if the current system can be tuned to mitigate distortion and feedback, documenting that even after tuning, deficiencies persist if applicable, and establish a chain of accountability to address the lack of leadership.
	•	Phase 2: Design & Procurement 
	•	We will finalize the speaker distribution layout, incorporating virtual simulation results (e.g., EASE, ODEON, CATT-Acoustic) and on-site acoustic data from our analysis, selecting from distributed, line array, or column array systems with beam-steering technology for each zone (mihrab, central dome, main prayer hall, side aisles, archways, courtyard, minarets, Athan Room) to ensure consistent, reliable coverage, with DSP, Dante networking, zone-specific processing (see Section 4.1 Control Room Devices (Mixer and Amplifiers), including anti-feedback and anti-tampering measures), and control room specifications, as designed by us, using the AutoCAD file for precise dimensions and scaling, adjusted for the carpet change and feedback requirements for the Athan Room and Mihrab, with password-protected settings and lockouts to prevent blown speakers. The audit recommends coverage mapping to identify dead zones, which we’ll include in the simulation, ensuring 8–12 column speakers cover the prayer hall adequately. We will also consider the external recommendation (see Section 4.7 Evaluation of External Equipment Recommendation) for TOA TU-660M, JBL AH7115, and other components, adjusting as needed for compatibility and equipment selection, accounting for the carpet’s acoustic impact, anti-feedback needs to address observed issues, and prevention of blown speakers through secure settings.
	•	We will source equipment from trusted vendors (e.g., local distributors in Syria or international suppliers like Bose, JBL, Renkus-Heinz, Nexo, QSC, Biamp, BSS, Yamaha, Shure, Audinate, dbx, Sennheiser, AKG, Middle Atlantic, Crown, TOA, Electro-Voice), based on our recommendations, ensuring a unified system to replace the diverse, vendor-diverse setup (e.g., Dynacord, Inter-M, TOA, PROEL, Turbosound, UNI-PEX, PASO), including new exterior speakers for the courtyard and upgraded minaret speakers to maintain consistent coverage, with anti-feedback solutions and secure lockouts for the Athan Room and Mihrab, adjusted for the carpet change’s requirements and prevention of blown speakers through password protection. We’ll include headroom for future expansion (e.g., extra input channels, unused amp channels) and implement measures to secure equipment against theft.
	•	Phase 3: Installation & Testing 
	•	We will install new control room devices (mixer and amplifiers, see Section 4.1 Control Room Devices (Mixer and Amplifiers)) and speakers (see Section 4.2 Speakers), including column arrays on Corinthian columns, directional ceiling speakers, line arrays, delayed speakers, and column speakers for minarets, amplifiers, DSP processors (QSC Q-SYS, Biamp TesiraFORTE, BSS Soundweb London BLU-100) with beam-steering and zone-specific compressors/limiters/feedback suppressors, multiple wireless (Shure ULX-D, Sennheiser XSW 1-835) and wired mics (Shure MX418, AKG C414 XLII, Shure SM58), Dante-enabled equipment (Yamaha MRX7-D, Shure ULX-D, Audinate AVIO), control room monitors (Yamaha HS5), and a professional-grade rack, ensuring proper alignment, zoning, and integration for each acoustic zone to ensure consistent, reliable coverage, as part of our implementation efforts, adjusted for the carpet change’s acoustic impact, incorporating anti-feedback and anti-tampering measures for the Athan Room and Mihrab to address observed feedback, and preventing blown speakers through password protection and physical lockouts.
	•	We will ensure seamless integration of all components, with particular attention to the Dante audio network (using Ethernet and analog audio cables) for efficient signal routing and minimal latency, testing the system for coverage, delay, intelligibility (using STIPA analyzers), reverberation (using RT60 tools), and latency (using Dante Controller) to verify consistent, reliable audio, making adjustments as needed across the mosque layout and its zones, including testing zone-specific processing, verifying power distribution for the unified system, tuning anti-feedback settings (dbx AFS2, dbx AFS224) for the Athan Room and Mihrab to eliminate observed feedback during adhan and sermons, ensuring proper organization of the rack and cabling, focusing on beam-steering for the central dome and delayed speakers in the courtyard, with password-protected DSP settings and lockouts to prevent blown speakers due to tampering, as developed by us, adjusted for the carpet change’s effect on test results and feedback potential. The audit recommends using a real-time analyzer to EQ the system, rolling off bass below 125 Hz on columns and taming mid-range peaks to avoid exciting the dome and address distortion, ensuring calibrated delay settings to synchronize sound arrivals, and verifying with post-installation STI measurements across listener positions, all of which we’ve incorporated. We will also integrate the equipment we previously purchased—dbx AFS2, Sennheiser XSW 1-835, AKG C414 XLII, dbx 215s, and EBL Rechargeable Batteries and Charger—into the system, securing them against tampering and theft to maintain consistent coverage and prevent blown speakers, as these items remain available for future use following the resistance we faced from the mosque staff during our visit. Testing will align with Section 1.2, including weather condition tests for the Athan.
	•	Phase 4: Training & Handover 
	•	We will train mosque staff on operating and maintaining the new system, including use of the Athan Room setup, DSP/Dante configurations, beam-steering technology, zone-specific processing (compressors, limiters, feedback suppressors, including anti-feedback and anti-tampering measures for the Athan Room and Mihrab), multiple wireless/wired mics, control room operations, and intelligibility optimization tools for each acoustic zone to ensure consistent, reliable coverage, based on our expertise. This training will address the lack of training we observed, ensuring staff are equipped with the knowledge and skills to manage the unified system effectively, verify power distribution, maintain accountability to replace the absent leadership, calibrate anti-feedback settings to eliminate observed feedback, and prevent blown speakers through password protection and lockouts, adjusted for the carpet change’s impact on system performance. The audit recommends detailed documentation and training on microphone usage (e.g., proper placement, battery management for wireless mics), which we’ll include to address current mishandling.
	•	We will provide detailed documentation and a maintenance schedule, as prepared by us, to establish clear accountability and operational standards, rectifying the absence of documentation and leadership we encountered, ensuring proper use and organization of the mixer, rack, and cabling, with precise layouts informed by the AutoCAD file, adjusted for the carpet change’s impact, and implementing security measures to prevent equipment theft, which we observed daily during our visit.
